# GPU-Test
Testing the cluster for the RL for Baseball Scheduling Project

# Spring 2023
Transitioned from Google OR Tools to Gurobi, which seemed to offer a 10X speedup for the testing.

# Summer 2023
Conducted tests for the scenarios on the CPU and took about 15 hours to run all the scenarios in parallel with Gurobi. 

# Fall 2023 
Plan to set up the GPU and the clusters for faster testing so that I can experiment with the effects of different gamma values.
